Documents:
    -Document storage and retrieval engine
    -Not just txt, can work with json

Types:
    -Define schema and mapping shared by documents that represent
        same sort of thing

Indices:
    -An index powers search into all documents within a collection
        of types. Contain inverted index that let you search
        across everything within them at once

    -An index is split into shards
        -Each shard may be a different node in a cluster
        -Every shard is a self-container Lucene index of its own
                -> Every shard is a mini elasticSearch engine by it's own

    -Redundancy:
        -Each index has some primary shards and some replicas
        -The application should round-robin requests amongst nodes
        -Write requests are routed to the primary shard, then replicated
        -Read requests are routed to the primary or any replica
