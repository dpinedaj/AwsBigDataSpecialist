Amazon ES anti-patterns:
    -OLTP ->On Line Transactions Processing
        -ES is not good on transactions
        -RDS or DynamoDB may be better
    -Ad-hoc data querying -> dinamic querying depending on an specific id or field
        -Athena is better
    -Remember Amazon ES is primarily for search & analytics
