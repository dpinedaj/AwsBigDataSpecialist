Redshift Workload Management (WLM):
    -Priorize short, fast queries vs long, slow queries
    -Query queues
    -Via console, CLI, or API

Automatic Worload Management:
    -Creates up to 8 queues
    -Large queries (ie big hash joins) -> concurrency lowered
    -Small queries (ie inserts, scans, aggregations) -> concurrency raised
    -Can be defined boundary conditions and the steps to follow if any boundary is passed
    
    -Configuring query queues:
        -Priority
        -Concurrency scaling mode
        -User groups
        -Query groups
        -Query monitoring rules

Manual Workload Management:
    -One default queue with concurrency level of 5 (5 queries at once)
    -Superuser queue with concurrency level 1
    -Define up to 8 queues, up to concurrency level 50
        -Each can have defined concurrency scaling mode, concurrency level, user groups
            query groups, memory, timeout, query monitoring rules
        -Can also enable query queue hopping
            -Timed out queries "hop" to next queue to try again
