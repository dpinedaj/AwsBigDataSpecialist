Short Query Acceleration (SQA):
    -Prioritize short-running queries over longer-running ones
    -Short queries run in a deadicated space, won't wait in queue behind long queries
    -Can be used in place of WLM queues for short queries

    -Works with:
        -CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS)
        -Read-only queries (SELECT statements)
    -Uses machine learning to predict a query's execution time
    -Can configure how many seconds is "short"
