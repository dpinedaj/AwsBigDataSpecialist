Right now we will perform the requirement 6: Data warehousing and visualization
-With Redshift we will perform a managed solution instead of serverless Glue-Athena's one


Redshift Spectrum steps:

1. Make sure that the data from previous exercises are in S3 (maybe must be needed to create
    a Kinesis Firehose again and generate logs with the python script)
    and is necessary to perform again the glue data crawler to get data into Glue Data Catalog

2. Go to Amazon IAM in the AWS Console
    -Roles
        ->Click on Create Role
            -AWS service
                -Redshift
                -Redshift-Customizable
                ->Click on Next: Permissions

                Select:
                    -AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
                    -AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess
                    ->Click on Next:Tags
                ->Click on Next: Review
                -Role name: RedshiftSpectrum
                --->Copy the role arn and paste into an accesible place
                ->Click on Create Role

3. Go to Amazon Redshift in the AWS Console
    ->Click on Create cluster
        -Select the cheaper version (dc2.large)
        -1 node
        -Cluster identifier: cadabra
        -database port: 5439
        -Master user name: select one
        -Master user password: select one
        -Cluster permissions:
            ###It's important to grant permissions through Glue Data Catalog and S3
            -Select IAM Role
            -> Click on Add IAM role
        -Additional configurations:
            -default settings
        ->Click on Create cluster

4. Go into cadabra cluster
    ->Click on Editor
        -Log in with password created previously

        -Create external schema:
            -On editor write:
                -"CREATE external schema orderlog_schema from data catalog
                  database 'orderlogs'
                  iam_role '<arn_role pasted in step 2>'
                  region 'us-east-1'"
            ->click on Run

        ->Refresh Data objects
        -Check if schema is existing
        -Explore the table
            -On editor write:
                -"SELECT description, count(*) FROM orderlog_schema.orderlogs_sundogeku
                  WHERE country='France' and year='2020' and month='08'
                  GROUP BY description"
            ->Click on Run
