S3DistCP
    -Tool for copying large amounts of data
        -From S3 into HDFS
        -From HDFS into S3
    -Uses MapReduce to copy in a distributed manner
    -Suitable for parallel copying of large numbers of objects
        -Across buckets, across accounts

Ganglia:
    -Monitoring with data storage and visualization tool
    -Helps to link multiple clusters and can monitore them
    -Is configured to ingest and visualize Hadoop and Spark metrics
    -Opened in a browser shows the cluster's performance with graphs detailing the load, memory usage, CPU utilization, network traffic

Mahout:
    -Machine Learning library

Accumulo:
    -Another NoSQL database based in bigTable from google, his main principle is the 
        security, each key/value pair has its own security label which limits query results based on 
        user authorizations
    
Sqoop:
    -Relational database connector
    -Efficiently transfer data between structured, semi-structured and unstructured data sources
        to HDFS with the option of compress it in different binary formats and create a hive table on the way
    -An sqoop import example:
        -   sqoop import 
            --connect jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<sid> 
            --query 'SELECT * from <table_name>' 
            --username <user> -password <pwd> --incremental append 
            --last-value <lastValue> -check-column <lastValueCol> 
            --target-dir hdfs://<hdfs_path>

HCatalog:
    -Table and storage management for Hive metastore
    -Allows different data tool sources to write and manage data from hive

Kinesis Connector:
    -Directly access kinesis stream in your scripts
    -Is a library that allows to access data easily from code to kinesis data streams

Tachyon:
    -Accelerator for Spark
    -Written in java and supports many frameworks such spark, hadoop and Shark, it store data into memory and allows to share it into different clusters
        getting a better performance of sharing data
    -Is the default "off-heap" option in Spark, which means that RDDs can automatically be stored inside Tachyon to make spark more resilient
        and avoid GC overheads

Derby:
    -Open source relational DB in Java
    -Database Engine which is used as a lightweight db into java applications

Ranger:
    -Data security manager for Hadoop
    -Centralized security administration to manage all security related tasks in a central UI or using REST APIs
    -Centralize auditing of user access and administrative actions (security related) within all the components of Hadoop
