What is HBase:
    -The project's goal is the hosting of very large tables 
        (billions of rows X millions of columns)
    -Non-relational and column oriented database
    -Allows Google's BigTable operations like memory compression
        bloom filter (probabilistic statistical filtering) on columns base
    -Allows Hive integration
    -Operate the queries in-memory

When to Use:
    -Use it when you need random, realtime read/write access to Big Data
    -Use when the most of tools implemented are in hadoop ecosystem
