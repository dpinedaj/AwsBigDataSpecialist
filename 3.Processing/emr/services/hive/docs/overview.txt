Hive:
    -Basically structured Data living on hadoop YARN
    -Is on top of MapReduce that allows to do distributed process on 
        SQL in underlying data
    -Also can use Tez inplace of MapReduce:

        '
        -Tez is a framework that generalizes the MapReduce paradigm by
            treating computations as DAGs
        -MapReduce tasks are combined into a single job that is treated as a node
            in the DAG, enforcing concurrency and serialization.
        -The edges of the DAG represents the movement of data between jobs
        -Is data type-agnostic, which means that i'ts concerned only with the movement
            of the data and not the format it takes
