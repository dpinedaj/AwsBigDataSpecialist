How it Works:
    -Driver program:
        -Contain Spark Context where runs the main spark program
            Spark Context connect all the cluster managers taking care of the resource that will need the
            applications

    -In EMR is using a Cluster Manager
        -Uses Apache YARN to manage cluster resources and interactions
    
    -Executors:
        -Process and run computations and store the data for applications
        -Spark context sends what applications to run
