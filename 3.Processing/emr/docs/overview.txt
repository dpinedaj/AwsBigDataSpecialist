Elastic MapReduce
    -Managed Hadoop framework on EC2 instances
    -Includes Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink, Hive & more
    -EMR Notebooks--->using python in a browser
    -Integration points with AWS

Architecture:
    -Every cluster have just a Master Node
        -Single EC2 Instance
    -Core node execute tast and store data
        -Host HDFS data and runs tasks
        -Can be scaled up & down, but with some risk
    -Task node: Run tasks, does not host data:
        -No risk of data loss when removing
        -Good use of spot instances
    
Usage:
    -Transient (many times up-down clusters) vs Long-Running Clusters
        -can spit up task nodes using spot instances for temporary capacity
        -can use reserved instances on long-running clusters to save $
