Recommended stance types:
    -Master node:
        -m4.large  if < 50 nodes
        -m4.xlarge if > 50 nodes

    -Core & task nodes:
        -m4.large is usually good 
        -t2.medium if cluster waits a lot on external dependencies (i.e. a web crawler)
        -m4.xlarge for Improved performance
            -Computation-intensive applications
            -Database, memory-caching applications
            -Network /CPU-intensive (NLP, ML)
    
    -Spot instances:
        -Good choice for task nodes
        -Only use on core & master if you're testing or very cost-sensitive; you're risking partial data loss
