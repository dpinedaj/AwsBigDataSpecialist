Glue ETL:
    -Automatic code generation
    -Scala or Python
    -Encryption:
        -Server-side (at rest)
        -SSL (in transit)
        -Can provision additional "DPUs" (data processing units) to increase
         performance of underlying Spark Jobs


General:
    -An Glue ETL can transform data, clean data, Enrich data (before analysis)
        -Generate ETL code in Python or Scala which is modificable
        -Can be provided own Spark or PySpark scripts from scratch
        -Target can be S3, JDBC (RDS, Redshift) or Glue Data Catalog
    -Job are run on a serveless Spark platform

    -Glue Scheduler to schedule the Jobs
    -Glue Triggers to automate job runs based on "events" --->???

Transformations:
    -Bundled:
        -DropFields, DropNullFields -> remove (null) fields
        -filter -> specify a function to filter recors
        -Join -> to enrich data
        -Map  -> add fields, delete fields, perform external lookups
    
    -Machine Learning:
        -FindMatches ML: Identify duplicate or matching records in your dataset,
        even when the records do not have a common unique identifier and no fields match exactly
        -Format conversions: CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, XML
        -Apache Spark transformations (example: K-Means)

Endpoints:
    -ETL scripts using a notebook
        -Then create an ETL job that runs your script (using spark and glue)
    -Endpoint is in a VPC controlled by security groups, connect via:
        -Apache Zeppelin on a local machine
        -Zeppelin notebook server on EC2
        -SageMaker notebook
        -PyCharm professional edition

Glue Jobs:
    -Time-based schedules (cron style)
    -Job bookmarks
        -Persist state from the job run
        -prevents reprocessing of old data
        -Allows to process new data only when re-running on a schedule
        -Works with S3 sources in a variety of formats
        -Works with relational databses via JDBC
        
    -CloudWatch events
        -Fire off a lambda function or SNS notification when ETL succeds or fails
        -Invoke EC2 run, send event to Kinesis, activate a Step Functior
