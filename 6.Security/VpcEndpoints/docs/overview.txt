VPC Endpoints:
    -Allow you to connect to AWS using a private network instead of the public www network
    -They scale horizontally and are redundant
    -They remove the need of IGW, NAT, etc...
        to access AWS Services

    -Gateway: Provisions a target and must be used in a route table
        ONLY S3 and Dynamo DB
