Encryption in flight (SSL):
    -In some transactions like credit card data is so important
        that the data isn't available in flight
    -Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after sending
    -SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS)
    -Ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen
