Server side encryption at rest:
    -Data is encrypted after beign received by the server
    -Data is decrypted before beign sent
    -It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a data key)
    -The encryption /decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have
        access to it
